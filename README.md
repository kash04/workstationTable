# workstationTable
A simple workstation table at 36.5" height designed for makerspace use.

Thank you for downloading this set of files to make your own workstation table. It's designed to function much like a science-class style table, and for multiple to be able to be pushed back to back to create larger tables. Handles on the side make it easy to move this fairly lightweight but sturdy and stable table. You’ll find fusion and step archives of the table, as well as dxf (vector) files of each component. This design requires 2 4x8 sheets of 18mm baltic birch plywood and assumes your plywood is .72" in thickness on average. While this is not always the case, I have found 18mm baltic birch to be about this thickness, while some home improvement store plywood may be slightly thicker and could result in the table being harder to assemble. I recommend assembling this with Spax brand 1 1/2” MDF+Hardwood T15 self-drilling screws. I also recommend using a 1/8" roundover on both sides of the "handles" before assembly.

This design is free to use and share - both free as in beer and free as in freedom, and we appreciate you crediting us and sharing alike.
